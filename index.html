        <p>Something excited happened!!I started coding!! I signed up to a course on code first girls and was watching a video about career development. The presenter had mentioned another company called code your future.. so.. I signed up for <strong>their</strong> course. And while I was doing that course, it led me to Khan academy! What a journey!!  </p>
